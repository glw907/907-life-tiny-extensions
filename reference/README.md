# Reference Materials

This directory contains project-related documents that aren't part of the plugin code itself. These are editorial, administrative, and contributor-facing materials.

## Contents

### new-author-guide.md
Guest writer guide for 907.life contributors. This document is published on the site (without navigation) so it can be shared via direct link.

**Usage**: Edit locally, then publish via Micro.blog UI to create the live page.

## Purpose

Keep editorial and administrative documents:
- Separate from plugin code (`layouts/`, `static/`, `context/`)
- Version controlled for history and collaboration
- Easily accessible for reference and updates

## Adding New Documents

Use this directory for:
- Editorial guidelines and style guides
- Contributor documentation
- Publishing workflows
- Administrative procedures
- Content calendars or planning docs

**Don't use for**:
- Plugin code (goes in `layouts/`, `static/`, etc.)
- Context documentation for Claude (goes in `context/`)
- Site content (gets published via Micro.blog directly)
