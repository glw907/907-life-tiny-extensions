## Welcome Page: Problem-Solution Framework

**Demonstrates**: Conversational authority, problem-solution structure, audience segmentation

### Excerpt

> If you're here, you've likely recognized that smartphones have hijacked attention in ways that feel increasingly incompatible with living a meaningful, focused life.
>
> The answer is removing the obvious source. Not "mindful scrolling," not grayscale mode, not "digital minimalism" compromises. Those strategies assume the problem can be solved through optimization. Experience suggests otherwise. The issue isn't usage patterns—it's the device itself.
>
> I haven't used a smartphone in three years. This site documents what that looks like in practice: reviews of alternatives (dumbphones, companion devices, auxiliary tools), guides for common obstacles (work requirements, navigation, communication), and essays on the philosophy of intentional friction.
>
> **What this isn't:** I have no money from this blog, no affiliate links, no sponsorships, no courses to sell. This is documentation, not evangelism. Your situation differs from mine. Maybe you can't eliminate a smartphone entirely—work restrictions, family obligations, legitimate access needs. That's fine. The goal is helping you make more intentional choices about technology, whatever form those choices take.

**What This Shows**:
- **Opening hook**: Directly addresses reader's likely situation ("If you're here...")
- **Clear position**: Bold claim without hedging ("removing the obvious source")
- **Personal authority**: Establishes credibility through experience ("three years")
- **Honest disclaimers**: No financial motivation, acknowledges nuance
- **Audience awareness**: "Your situation differs from mine"
- **Sentence rhythm**: Mix of short declaratives and longer explanations

## Reviews Page: Pedagogical Structure

**Demonstrates**: Layered definitions, comparative framing, building credibility through transparency

### Excerpt

> I've spent nearly two years evaluating dumbphones, e-readers, cameras, GPS units, and other tools designed to replace specific smartphone functions. Before that, I worked at [companies], competed in [competitions], and spent considerable time thinking about attention, distraction, and tool design.
>
> Reviews here follow a consistent framework built around the concept of **intentional friction**—the idea that removing convenience can paradoxically improve quality of life by eliminating reflexive, unconscious behavior.
>
> Smartphones excel at minimizing friction: one device, instant access, zero thought required. That convenience is precisely the problem. You don't consciously decide to check email or scroll social media; the phone is simply there, requiring no deliberation.
>
> Dumbphones and auxiliary devices reintroduce friction. They're slower, less capable, sometimes frustrating. But that friction creates space for conscious choice. You can't mindlessly scroll if your phone can't load social media. You don't have to resist temptation because you simply remove the trigger.

**What This Shows**:
- **Credibility building**: Background disclosure without credential-dropping
- **Concept introduction**: "Intentional friction" defined clearly
- **Comparative framing**: "Smartphones excel at X, which is precisely the problem"
- **Logical progression**: Problem identification → concept explanation → solution framework
- **Teaching approach**: Help readers understand *how* to evaluate, not just what to buy

## Contact Page: Personal Grounding

**Demonstrates**: Active voice, geographic specificity, authentic connection

### Excerpt

> I'm Geoff Wright, living in Anchorage, Alaska. I grew up in Iowa, spent time in Nebraska and Maryland, and eventually settled in Alaska where I've been for [years].
>
> I love snow, cross country skiing, biking, and the kind of quiet that comes from winter darkness and sub-zero temperatures. I haven't used a smartphone in three years, which shapes how I navigate both technology and daily life.
>
> This site documents that experience—not as prescription, but as one person's experiment in reclaiming attention and building a more intentional relationship with technology.

**What This Shows**:
- **Geographic grounding**: Multiple location references establish rootedness
- **Active voice**: "I love," "I grew up," not passive descriptions
- **Personal details**: Specific interests that paint a picture
- **Defining characteristic**: "three years" upfront establishes thematic alignment
- **Humble framing**: "one person's experiment" not "expert guidance"

---

## Also Page: Eclectic Voice

**Demonstrates**: Self-aware humor, low-ego presentation, embracing variety

### Description Text

> The "Also" section lists all my other personal writing—Alaska adventures, philosophical musings, reviews, recipes, and whatever else comes to mind.

**What This Shows**:
- **Self-aware categorization**: "whatever else comes to mind" acknowledges eclecticism
- **Casual tone**: Comma-separated list, no pretension
- **Permission for variety**: Not every post needs to be on-theme
- **Low-ego framing**: "musings" not "insights"

## Sentence Rhythm Examples

### Short Declarative

> The answer is removing the obvious source.

> Smartphones excel at minimizing friction.

> The issue isn't usage patterns—it's the device itself.

**Purpose**: Creates emphasis, drives point home, easy to scan.

### Long Explanatory

> If you're here, you've likely recognized that smartphones have hijacked attention in ways that feel increasingly incompatible with living a meaningful, focused life.

> This site documents what that looks like in practice: reviews of alternatives (dumbphones, companion devices, auxiliary tools), guides for common obstacles (work requirements, navigation, communication), and essays on the philosophy of intentional friction.

**Purpose**: Provides nuance, explains complexity, maintains flow.

### Mixed in Sequence

> Experience suggests otherwise. The issue isn't usage patterns—it's the device itself. [Short]
>
> I haven't used a smartphone in three years. This site documents what that looks like in practice: reviews of alternatives, guides for common obstacles, and essays on the philosophy of intentional friction. [Mixed]

**Effect**: Creates rhythm that holds attention without monotony.

## Parallel Structure Examples

### Enumeration

> no affiliate links, no sponsorships, no courses to sell

> I love snow, cross country skiing, biking, and the kind of quiet that comes from winter darkness

**Purpose**: Creates memorable phrasing, emphasizes completeness.

### Contrasts

> You don't consciously decide to check email or scroll social media; the phone is simply there, requiring no deliberation.

> You can't mindlessly scroll if your phone can't load social media. You don't have to resist temptation because you simply remove the trigger.

**Purpose**: Illuminates differences, clarifies arguments.

---

## Comparative Framing Examples

### Problem-Solution Contrast

> **Optimization assumes**: the problem is solvable within the system
> **Elimination recognizes**: the system itself is the problem

### Friction Contrast

> **Smartphones**: one device, instant access, zero thought required
> **Dumbphones**: slower, less capable, require conscious choice

**Purpose**: Help readers understand why standard approaches don't work, why alternative approach makes sense.

## Before/After Examples

### Before: Vague and Preachy

❌ "Many people struggle with smartphone addiction. Studies show it's harmful. You should consider alternatives."

**Problems**:
- Vague ("many people")
- Abstract ("studies show")
- Preachy ("you should")
- No personal grounding

### After: Specific and Personal

✅ "I haven't used a smartphone in three years. Here's what that looks like: I carry a Light Phone 2 for calls/texts, a Garmin GPS for navigation, and occasionally borrow my partner's phone for two-factor authentication."

**Improvements**:
- Specific timeframe ("three years")
- Concrete examples (actual device names)
- Personal authority ("I carry")
- Honest limitations (borrowing for 2FA)

---

### Before: Marketing Language

❌ "This revolutionary approach will transform your relationship with technology and unlock unprecedented focus and productivity."

**Problems**:
- Superlatives ("revolutionary," "unprecedented")
- Vague benefits ("transform your relationship")
- Sales pitch tone

### After: Honest Assessment

✅ "Ditching a smartphone means genuine trade-offs: slower communication, manual navigation lookups, occasional frustration. But for me, those inconveniences are preferable to constant distraction and reflexive checking."

**Improvements**:
- Acknowledges trade-offs
- Specific drawbacks named
- Personal framing ("for me")
- Honest about frustration

---

### Before: Absolutist Tone

❌ "Everyone needs to eliminate smartphones. There's no other way to reclaim attention. Anyone still using one is choosing distraction."

**Problems**:
- Universal claim ("everyone")
- No nuance ("no other way")
- Judgmental ("choosing distraction")

### After: Nuanced Position

✅ "The answer for me was elimination. Your answer might be different—work requirements, accessibility needs, or different priorities may make full elimination impractical. The goal is intentional choice, whatever form that takes."

**Improvements**:
- Personal framing ("for me")
- Acknowledges alternatives ("might be different")
- Respects constraints ("work requirements")
- Defines core goal without prescribing method
