## Voice & Tone

### Conversational Authority

**Establish credibility through personal experience**, not abstract expertise.

✅ **Good**: "I haven't used a smartphone in three years. Here's what I've learned about navigation..."

❌ **Avoid**: "Research shows that smartphone users experience difficulties with..."

**Characteristics**:
- First-person perspective when sharing experience
- Demonstrate deep knowledge through specificity
- Maintain accessibility while showing expertise
- Present reasoned arguments, not pronouncements

### Honest and Self-Aware

**Acknowledge complexity and nuance.**

**Characteristics**:
- Address different reader circumstances and constraints
- Admit limitations and unknowns
- Use self-aware humor without pretension ("philosophical musings" not "expert insights")
- Show genuine curiosity, not authoritative certainty
- Low-ego presentation

**Example patterns**:
- "This works for me, but your situation may differ..."
- "I don't have a perfect solution, but here's what helped..."
- "If you're in [specific situation], you might need [alternative approach]..."

### Personal and Grounded

**Root writing in biographical and geographic specificity.**

**Characteristics**:
- Use active voice: what you *do* and *love*, not passive descriptions
- Share vulnerable details that establish authentic connection
- Ground claims in real experience
- Welcome eclectic interests beyond the site's core theme

**Example patterns**:
- "Living in Anchorage, I've found..."
- "Before ditching my smartphone, I worked at..."
- "I love cross country skiing, which requires..."

## Structure & Organization

### Problem-Solution-Implementation Framework

**Standard structure for guides and explanatory content:**

1. **Acknowledge the problem** (with specificity)
   - Name the concrete obstacle
   - Show understanding of reader's situation
   - Avoid vague problem statements

2. **Present the solution** (with honesty about trade-offs)
   - Explain the approach clearly
   - Acknowledge what won't work
   - Be transparent about limitations

3. **Address practical obstacles**
   - Anticipate real-world challenges
   - Provide workarounds or alternatives
   - Segment by different user situations

4. **Provide actionable next steps**
   - Make it concrete and doable
   - Link to specific resources
   - Suggest starting points

### Pedagogical Layering

**For reviews and complex topics, build arguments systematically:**

1. **Narrative credibility** - Establish personal authority
2. **Philosophical foundation** - Explain the framework
3. **Taxonomy** - Define categories and terms
4. **Methodology** - Show how you evaluate

**Purpose**: Teach readers *how* to think about problems, not just what to do.

**Techniques**:
- Give complex concepts full treatment: conceptual explanation + practical examples + research links
- Layer definitions (simple → nuanced → comprehensive)
- Build each section on previous ones

### Scannable Content

**Make content easy to navigate and skim:**

- Clear section breaks with descriptive headings (h2, h3, h4)
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences typically)
- Strategic line breaks for emphasis
- Bullet points for lists and parallel ideas
- Hierarchical organization that creates logical flow

---

## Sentence Patterns

### Varied Rhythm

**Alternate short declarative statements with longer explanatory passages.**

This rhythm:
- Prevents monotony
- Maintains reader engagement
- Mirrors the site's message about intentional pacing over constant stimulation

**Examples**:

Short declarative: "The answer is removing the obvious source."

Long explanatory: "If you're here, you've likely recognized that smartphones have hijacked attention in ways that feel increasingly incompatible with living a meaningful, focused life."

### Parallel Structure

**Use balanced construction for emphasis and clarity**, especially in lists.

**Examples**:
- "no affiliate links, no sponsorships, no courses to sell"
- "I love snow, cross country skiing, biking"

**When to use**:
- Enumerating multiple items
- Emphasizing related concepts
- Creating memorable phrases

### Comparative Framing

**Use contrasts to illuminate ideas**, not just oppose viewpoints.

**Examples**:
- "You don't have to resist temptation... you simply remove the trigger"
- "Optimization assumes the problem is solvable within the system. Elimination recognizes the system itself is the problem."

**Purpose**:
- Clarify nuanced differences
- Help readers understand alternatives
- Avoid binary thinking while still making clear recommendations

## Punctuation

### Use Contextually Appropriate Punctuation

**Avoid overusing em dashes.** Choose the punctuation mark that best serves the specific context.

### Colons (:)

**Use for introducing lists, explanations, or elaborations.**

✅ **Good**: "This site documents what that looks like in practice: reviews of alternatives, guides for common obstacles, and essays on the philosophy of intentional friction."

✅ **Good**: "The problem is simple: smartphones are designed to capture attention."

**When to use**:
- Introducing a list or series
- Introducing an explanation or elaboration
- Setting up an example or clarification

### Semicolons (;)

**Use to connect related independent clauses without a conjunction.**

✅ **Good**: "You don't consciously decide to check email or scroll social media; the phone is simply there, requiring no deliberation."

✅ **Good**: "Smartphones minimize friction; dumbphones reintroduce it."

**When to use**:
- Linking closely related thoughts
- Showing cause and effect
- Creating balance between two ideas

### Parentheses ( )

**Use for asides, examples, or clarifying information.**

✅ **Good**: "This site documents alternatives (dumbphones, companion devices, auxiliary tools) for specific smartphone functions."

✅ **Good**: "I lived in several places (Iowa, Nebraska, Maryland) before settling in Alaska."

**When to use**:
- Providing examples without disrupting flow
- Adding clarifying details
- Including supplementary information

### Em Dashes ( — )

**Use sparingly for emphasis, interruption, or sharp contrast. Always use spaced em dashes** (space before and after).

✅ **Good**: "The issue isn't usage patterns — it's the device itself."

✅ **Good**: "Those strategies assume the problem can be solved through optimization. Experience suggests otherwise — the device is the problem."

❌ **Avoid**: "The issue isn't usage patterns—it's the device itself." (no spaces)

❌ **Avoid**: Overusing em dashes where colons, semicolons, or parentheses would be clearer.

**When to use**:
- Creating dramatic emphasis
- Showing sharp contrast or pivot
- Interrupting for clarification
- When you need stronger separation than commas but want more energy than parentheses

**When NOT to use**:
- For simple lists (use colons or commas)
- For related clauses (use semicolons)
- For examples or asides (use parentheses)
- Multiple times in the same paragraph

### Commas

**Use for standard separations, but don't overload sentences.**

✅ **Good**: "I love snow, cross country skiing, biking, and the kind of quiet that comes from winter darkness."

✅ **Good**: "Maybe you can't eliminate a smartphone entirely — work restrictions, family obligations, legitimate access needs."

**When to use**:
- Separating items in a series
- Setting off introductory phrases
- Separating independent clauses with conjunctions
- Setting off non-essential information

### Periods

**Use to create crisp, clear statements. Don't fear short sentences.**

✅ **Good**: "The answer is removing the obvious source. Not 'mindful scrolling,' not grayscale mode, not 'digital minimalism' compromises."

**When to use**:
- Ending complete thoughts
- Creating rhythm with varied sentence length
- Emphasizing a point through brevity

---

## Specificity & Evidence

### Concrete Over Abstract

**Name specific obstacles, tools, and examples.**

✅ **Good**: "Two-factor authentication, navigation apps, and work email access are the three most common objections I hear."

❌ **Avoid**: "People face various challenges when trying to reduce smartphone use."

**Techniques**:
- Use actual product names
- Cite specific situations
- Provide real-world examples from your experience
- Give numbers when relevant ("three years," "15 most recent")

### Audience Segmentation

**Acknowledge that readers have different circumstances.**

**Techniques**:
- Identify distinct groups with different constraints
- Address objections specific to each group
- Provide alternatives for different situations
- Avoid one-size-fits-all recommendations

**Example structure**:
"If you work in tech, you might need... If you have kids, consider... For remote workers, the challenge is..."

### Research Integration

**Use research to support experience, not replace it.**

**When to cite research**:
- Supporting a counter-intuitive claim
- Providing deeper context
- Showing you've done homework

**How to cite research**:
- Link directly to source
- Explain relevance clearly
- Don't hide behind credentials
- Personal experience + research > research alone
