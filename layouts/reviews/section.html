{{/*
  Template: /layouts/reviews/section.html
  Purpose: Editorial hub page for /reviews/ section (Tier 1 of two-tier architecture)

  TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE:
  This template is part of a two-tier design pattern:

  Tier 1 (THIS FILE - section.html):
  - Used for top-level editorial hub: /reviews/
  - Displays manually curated content from _index.md
  - Allows explaining review methodology, setting standards, linking to categories
  - Full editorial control over messaging and organization
  - Content written via Micro.blog web interface

  Tier 2 (list.html):
  - Used for auto-filtered subcategory pages: /reviews/dumbphones/, /reviews/software/
  - Automatically displays posts tagged with both "reviews" AND device type
  - No manual maintenance needed when adding posts

  Hugo determines which template to use based on URL depth:
  - /reviews/ → section.html (this file)
  - /reviews/{device-type}/ → list.html

  This separation provides editorial control at top level while automating
  the display of filtered posts at the category level.
